CHALLENGE:

1. Create a folder called 'mern stack'.  Create two folders within this directory called
   'backend' and 'frontend'

2. Inside of the 'backend' create a file called 'server.js'.

3. Navigate into the 'backend' folder and initiate the project.  Install the following
   packages: express, mongoose, dotenv

4. Create the Express application inside of the 'server.js' file.  Once created, 
   install the 'nodemon' dependency as a 'dev dependency'.  Go into the 'package.json' 
   file and modify the start script to be a 'dev' script, so that you can just use 'npm 
   run dev' in the command line.

5. Ensure that when you open the port that you are broadcasting from that it reads 'Express App is Working!'
