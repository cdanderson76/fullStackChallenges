1. Follow the steps in the document 'Create MongoDB Database'.  If you already have one created, skip this and do the following:

   Get the connection string from Mongo DB.  Create a '.env' file within the 'mern-crash-course' directory, and within this file, create a variable called MONGO_URI and
   store the connection string within that variable (do not use a 'const', 'let', etc).  Within this connection string, you need to change what's in the '<>'.  Delete what's in side of these brackets and 
   paste the MongoDB password for that database.

2. In the 'server.js' file, console log the connection to the MongoDB database to ensure that you are connected.
