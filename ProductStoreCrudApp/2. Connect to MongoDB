1. Change the 'get' route in 'server.js' to '/products'.

2. Follow the steps in the document 'Create MongoDB Database'.  If you already have one created, skip this and do the following:

   Get the connection string from Mongo DB.  Create a '.env' file within the 'mern-crash-course' directory, and within this file, create a variable called MONGO_URI and
   store the connection string within that variable (do not use a 'const', 'let', etc).  Within this connection string, you need to change what's in the '<>'.  Delete what's in side of these brackets and 
   paste the MongoDB password for that database.

3. In the 'server.js' file, console log the connection to the MongoDB database to ensure that you are connected.

4. Create a folder called 'config' inside of the 'backend' directory, and create a file within this new folder called 'db.js'.

5. Inside of the 'db.js' file, create an async function with a 'try/catch' using the mongoose package to connect to our database.  Console log the following if the 
   connection is successful:  MonoDB Connected: ${conn.connection.host}.  

   Log out the error message otherwise

6. Import the 'connectDB' function into 'server.js' and invoke it.
