1. Create a folder on your desktop called 'mern-crash-course'.  Inside of that folder, create folders called 'frontend' and 'backend'.  We will focus on 
   the backend first and build an API.  Once we build it, we will move on to the frontend.

2. Ensure that you are inside of the 'mern-crash-course' folder, and initialize/set up a new npm package.

3. Install the following packages: express, mongoose, and dotenv.  Also, install nodemon as a 'dev dependency'.  Check and ensure that they were installed.

4. Within the 'backend' folder, create a file called 'server.js'.  Import 'express' and create the 'express' app (listen on port 5000).  Once finished, you 
   need to move into the server folder, by way of the command line, and start the server.  Ensure that it says the following in the console once the server
   is started:

   Server started at http://localhost:5000

5. Create a route using the 'get' method, and display "HELLO WORLD" to the browser
