TO GET STARTED, DOWNLOAD THE ZIP FILE FROM THE FOLLOWING LOCATION:  https://github.com/cdanderson76/fullStackChallenges/blob/main/ProductStoreCrudApp/mern-crash-course2.zip
NOTE:  YOU WILL PROBABLY TEMPORARILY HAVE TO TURN OFF WINDOWS DEFENDER IN ORDER TO DOWNLOAD THE PREVIOUSLY LISTED FILE!!!

1. Create a folder called 'models' under the backend directory. Under this folder, create a file called 'product.model.js', and create the product model.  Each product
   will have the following:

   -name (which is a string, and it should be required)
   -price(which is a number, and it should be required)
   -image(which is a string, and it should be required)

    Also, ensure you add the appropriate syntax to provide 'createdAt' and 'updatedAt' properties to list when something was created and when it was updated.  Export the
    product when it's created.

2. Modify the 'get' request in 'server.js' to be a 'post'.  Ensure that you apply the proper logic that if all of the proper fields are filled out, that it saves a product
   to the MongoDB database.  Use the following for error codes:

   -400 if all of the fields aren't filled out, use STATUS ('please provide all fields')
   -201 for a successful save
   -500 if the product wasn't successfully saved use STATUS 'Server Error', and log 'Error in create product:' with the catch error message

3. Test this out using Postman.  When you test it out, be sure to change the endpoint to '/api/products' so that we know we are referencing the API service
