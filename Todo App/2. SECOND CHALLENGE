1. Download the zip folder from this location to your desktop: https://github.com/cdanderson76/fullStackChallenges/blob/main/Todo%20App/merntodo.zip
   NOTE:  YOU MAY HAVE TO TEMPORARILY TURN OFF THREAT PROTECTION FROM WINDOWS DEFENDER

2. Open the 'server' folder within the 'merntodo' folder and start the development server.  You should see 'Hello World!' in the console as a result

3. Import the web framework Express into the 'index.js' file.  HINT: You'll have to make a change to the 'package.json' file to do this.

4. Create an instance of the Express module.  Use port 3000 for the Express server, and define a get route that sends 'Hello World!' to the browser, and logs 'listening on port 3000' to the console.

5. Type in the proper URL in the browser to render what you see in Anki.
