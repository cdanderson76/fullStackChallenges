2. Create a folder within the 'server' directory called 'controllers', and within that folder, create the files 'auth.js' and 'todos.js'.  In THESE files, we will implement the logic of each route.

3. Create an async function called 'register', and send the text 'register route'.  Copy and paste this into '/controllers/auth.js'.  

4. Open the '/routes/auth.js' routes and import the async function into the file.  Replace the 'register' route with the appropriate syntax and test it out in Postman.  Repeat this process for the 'login' and 'logout' routes
