1. Download the zip folder from this location to your desktop: https://github.com/cdanderson76/fullStackChallenges/blob/main/Todo%20App/merntodo3.zip
   NOTE:  YOU MAY HAVE TO TEMPORARILY TURN OFF THREAT PROTECTION FROM WINDOWS DEFENDER

2. Create a folder within the 'server' directory called 'controllers', and within that folder, create the files 'auth.js' and 'todos.js'.  In THESE files, we will implement the logic of each route.

3. Create an async function called 'register', and send the text 'register route'.  Copy and paste this into '/controllers/auth.js'.  

4. Open the '/routes/auth.js' routes and import the async function into the file.  Replace the 'register' route with the appropriate syntax and test it out in Postman.  Repeat process 3-4 for the 
   'login' and 'logout' routes

5. Now, create async functions for the routes in '/controllers/todo.js'.  Repeat the same process for the associated file that's listed in steps 3-4.  Functions can be called as follows:

   -getAllTodos
   -getTodo
   -updateTodo
   -deleteTodo
   -addTodo

   Don't forget to test afterward...
