2. It's time to create our routes.  So inside of the server folder, create a 'routes' folder.  Inside of this folder, create files 'auth.js' and 'todo.js'.

3. Define all of your routes that will be associated with authentication in 'auth.js'.

4. Import the routes from the 'auth.js' file into 'index.js'.  

5. Test the route in Postman.  When you hit the 'login' endpoint, you should get 'login route' in the app console.  Ensure that you 'Save' it.

6. Test out the rest of the routes.
