1. Download the zip folder from this location to your desktop: https://github.com/cdanderson76/fullStackChallenges/blob/main/Todo%20App/merntodo4.zip
   NOTE:  YOU MAY HAVE TO TEMPORARILY TURN OFF THREAT PROTECTION FROM WINDOWS DEFENDER

2. Create a 'folder' within the 'server' directory.  Create two files under this directory:

   -userModel.js
   -todoModel.js

3. Go into the 'userModel.js' file, import 'mongoose' and then create the user schema (variable 'userSchema').  Export this once created.
   NOTE:  SCHEMA MUST INCLUDE EMAIL AND PASSWORD...

4. Copy and paste the syntax into the 'todoModel.js' file.  Make the appropriate changes and then export this as well.
   NOTE:  SCHEMA MUST INCLUDE USERID, TITLE, AND ISCOMPLETED

NOW LET'S CONNECT TO MONGODB!!!!

5. Inside of the server folder, you want to create a folder called 'utils'.  Inside of this folder, we will create a file called 'connect.js'

6. Inside of 'connect.js' import 'mongoose', and create a connection with the use of 'try/catch'.

7. Inside of the SERVER directory, create a '.env' file.  List the Mongo URI here as a sting variable and use it inside of 'connect.js'

8. Set up JWT secret key in the '.env' file.  Set up any string value for this.  Also, set up a 'node' environment variable

WHEN FINISHED, YOUR CONSOLE SHOULD STILL BE LISTENING ON ITS CURRENT PORT WITH NO ISSUES
